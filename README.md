# Working on C#

The repo's purpose is to improve the writing of code by solving coding challenges that 
I will find in some different training coding sites such as CodeWars, Edabit ect.. 

The language used is ![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/c%23-%23239120.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c-sharp&logoColor=white)
